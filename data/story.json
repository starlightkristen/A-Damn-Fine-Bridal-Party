  "overview": "In a town where secrets hide behind warm smiles and cherry pie, someone has crossed a dangerous line. What began as recipe theft has ended in tragedy. When Cassandra, a food blogger investigating local culinary heritage, is found dead from a poisoned pie slice, guests must unravel the truth. Was it about money, pride, or protecting a carefully constructed lie?",

  "solution": "Morgan Blackwood stole Norma's cherished cherry pie recipe and claimed it as her own family heritage to secure investor funding for an artisan pie business. When food blogger Cassandra Vale found proof of the theft through secret photos and interviews, Morgan silenced her with a poisoned pie slice. The cupcake reveal exposes Morgan's guilt, and Norma's recipe is returned to its rightful owner.",

Time the final envelope opening to happen BEFORE the cupcake reveal so all players understand the solution before the dramatic presentation. If guests struggle, have the Log Lady deliver an extra prophecy.",
