# Test and Alternative Files

This directory contains test files, debug pages, backup versions, and alternative implementations that are **not part of the production deployment**.

## 🧪 Debug and Test Pages

These files were used for testing and debugging during development:

- `debug.html` - General debugging page
- `debug-test.html` - Debug test page
- `render-debug.html` - Render function debugging
- `script-test.html` - Script testing page
- `simple-test.html` - Simple test page
- `minimal-test.html` - Minimal test page
- `test-save-fixes.html` - Save functionality testing
- `emergency-clean.html` - Emergency cleanup page

## 💾 Backup Versions

These are backup versions of production files, kept for reference:

- `index-backup.html` - Backup of index page
- `index-clean.html` - Clean version of index
- `index-fixed.html` - Fixed version of index
- `index-stable.html` - Stable version of index
- `decor-fixed.html` - Fixed version of decor page
- `mystery-fixed.html` - Fixed version of mystery page

## 🔀 Alternative Implementations

These files contain experimental or alternative implementations:

- `decor-wizard.html` - Alternative decor wizard interface

## 📋 Test Documentation

- `workflow-test.md` - Manual testing checklist for GitHub Pages deployment

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Do not use these files in production** - They may contain experimental code or outdated implementations
2. **These files are not deployed** - GitHub Pages deployment uses only the 8 production HTML files in the root directory
3. **Backup reference** - These files are kept for historical reference and in case any functionality needs to be restored
4. **Safe to delete** - If you're confident everything works, these files can be safely deleted

## 🎯 Production Files

The actual production files are in the root directory:
- `index.html`
- `login.html`
- `guests.html`
- `food.html`
- `decor.html`
- `mystery.html`
- `schedule.html`
- `admin.html`
