## 🎯 The Solution

**Complete Story:**

Morgan Blackwood stole Norma's cherished cherry pie recipe and claimed it as her own family heritage to secure investor funding for an artisan pie business. She convinced investors that this "generations-old heritage recipe" would make them all rich, securing $50K in promised funding.

Food blogger Cassandra Vale was researching authentic Twin Peaks recipes and family heritage stories. Through interviews with Norma and secret photographs of recipe cards, Cassandra discovered the truth: Morgan's recipe was stolen, not inherited. Morgan's family wasn't even originally from Twin Peaks.

When Cassandra threatened to publish her exposé titled "The Great Recipe Heist" complete with photo evidence, Morgan realized her entire business would collapse. The investors would demand their money back, her reputation would be destroyed, and her dreams would die.

In a desperate act, Morgan poisoned a slice of the stolen cherry pie and gave it to Cassandra as a "sample" during a meeting to "clear things up." The same recipe that was supposed to make Morgan rich became the murder weapon.

The cupcake reveal exposes Morgan's guilt to all the guests, and Norma's recipe is symbolically returned to its rightful owner. Love and truth win over greed and deception.
