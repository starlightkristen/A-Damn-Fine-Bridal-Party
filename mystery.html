                <strong>💡 About Character Assignments:</strong>
                <p>Your character is included with the invite so you can dress up if you want. Think themed outfit, not costume contest. Participation is easy and optional.</p>

                <strong>💡 Invite vs. Envelope Content:</strong>
                <p>We'll send the costume ideas and character intros early with their invites so they can prepare! We'll save the deep dark secrets and the investigation objectives for the sealed envelopes they'll open at the party.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <strong>The "Big Burn" Ceremony:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Prep:</strong> Each cupcake has a small piece of "flash paper" or heat-sensitive paper on a stick. On the back (hidden) is a single line of the story.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Advance:</strong> After Envelope 4 is opened, gather everyone around the dessert station.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Reveal:</strong> You (the Host) use the kitchen torch to light each cupcake's paper in order. As the paper burns away, the "Cherry Lie" is revealed!</li>
                    <li><strong>The Climax:</strong> Read each line aloud dramatically. The final cupcakes reveal Morgan's guilt and return the recipe to Norma.</li>
