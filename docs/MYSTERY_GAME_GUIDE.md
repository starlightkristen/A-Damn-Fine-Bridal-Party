## 2. WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO (Host Cheat Sheet)

Break it into bite-sized actions:

**YOUR ONLY JOBS:**
1. ✅ **At start**: Hand each guest their packet (envelope with their name)
2. ✅ **3 times during party**: Say "Okay everyone, open envelope [#]!" 
3. ✅ **At 1:40**: Bring out cupcakes with messages
4. ✅ **That's it.** Seriously.

**What you DON'T have to do:**
- ❌ Explain the whole mystery upfront
- ❌ Track who has what clues
- ❌ Make sure people "solve" it
- ❌ Narrate or perform
- ❌ Stress if people get confused

---

## 3. WHAT'S IN EACH PACKET (Visual Breakdown)

Show what guests actually receive:

```
📦 GUEST PACKET (one envelope with 4 smaller envelopes inside)

Their packet contains:
├─ Envelope 1 (Intro) ─────────┐
│  • Character name & role      │ ← They open this first
│  • Their secret               │    (when they arrive)
│  • Costume ideas (optional)   │
└────────────────────────────────┘

├─ Envelope 2 (Midpoint) ──────┐
│  • 1-2 clues to share         │ ← Open at 20-30 min
│  • Questions to ask others    │
└────────────────────────────────┘

├─ Envelope 3 (Ramp Up) ───────┐
│  • More dramatic clues        │ ← Open at 1 hour
│  • Suspicions forming         │
└────────────────────────────────┘

├─ Envelope 4 (Final) ─────────┐
│  • Final evidence             │ ← Open right before cupcakes
│  • "The truth is coming..."   │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 4. DAY-OF PREP CHECKLIST (Keep It Simple)

**The Night Before:**
- [ ] Print all packets (1 per guest) - *see `docs/PRINT_GUIDE.md` for easy instructions*
- [ ] Label each packet with guest name in BIG letters
- [ ] Put packets in a basket by the door

**Morning Of:**
- [ ] Order cupcakes OR frost 12 cupcakes (any flavor)
- [ ] Write these 12 messages on cupcake toppers/paper:
  ```
  MORGAN STOLE RECIPE
  FROM NORMA
  SECRET PHOTOS
  PIE BUSINESS
  FALSE HERITAGE
  INVESTORS HERE
  CASSANDRA FOUND PROOF
  POISONED SLICE
  MORGAN BLACKWOOD
  IS GUILTY
  RECIPE RETURNS
  LOVE WINS
  ```
- [ ] Set timer for these times (or just mental note):
  - 0:20 → "Open Envelope 2"
  - 1:00 → "Open Envelope 3"  
  - 1:40 → "Open Envelope 4" + bring out cupcakes

**When Guests Arrive:**
- [ ] Hand them their packet
- [ ] Say: "There are 4 envelopes inside. Open #1 now, I'll tell you when to open the rest!"
- [ ] **Relax and have fun** ☕

---

## 5. WHAT IF THINGS GO WRONG? (Troubleshooting)

**Scenario: Someone loses an envelope**
→ No problem! Just tell them what phase info they need verbally, or print a spare

**Scenario: People aren't talking/trading clues**
→ At envelope opening times, say: "Now's a great time to share what you learned!"

**Scenario: No one figures out the murderer**
→ That's totally fine! The cupcakes reveal the answer anyway. It's about the journey.

**Scenario: Someone solves it early**
→ Great! Ask them to keep quiet and see who else figures it out

**Scenario: You forget to call an envelope time**
→ Just do it when you remember. Flexible timing is fine.

**Scenario: You're stressed**
→ Remember: This is for FUN. If people are laughing and eating, you're doing it right.

## 6. WHAT GUESTS EXPERIENCE (Their Perspective)

Help visualize what it feels like for THEM:

**When They Arrive:**
- They get a packet with their character name
- Open Envelope 1 → "Oh, I'm the [Log Lady/Detective/etc.]! I have this secret..."
- They see costume suggestions (totally optional)
- They mingle, stay in character (lightly), chat

**During Investigation:**
- Envelopes give them clues to SHARE with others
- They trade info: "Did you hear about the recipe?" "I saw Morgan at the diner..."
- They start forming theories
- Some take it seriously, some just have fun with the theme - both are great!

**At The Reveal:**
- Cupcakes come out with messages
- Everyone reads them in order
- The solution is spelled out: Morgan stole the recipe, poisoned Cassandra
- Even if they didn't solve it, they get the "aha!" moment
- Everyone cheers, toasts, takes photos

**Bottom Line:** They have fun talking, eating, and piecing together a story. No pressure.

## 7. PRO TIPS (From Hosts Who've Done This)

✨ **Keep it light:** If someone says "I don't get it," just say "That's okay! Just chat with people and see what they know. The cupcakes will explain everything at the end."

✨ **You can adjust timing:** 2 hours is a guideline. If people are having fun mingling, stretch it. If energy is low, speed it up.

✨ **Food helps:** Have snacks/drinks available. People relax and engage more when fed.

✨ **Music sets the vibe:** Play the Twin Peaks soundtrack softly in the background (optional but atmospheric).

✨ **Take photos:** Especially at the cupcake reveal moment - it's the climax!

✨ **Backup plan:** If the mystery bombs, you still have a themed party with food, friends, and fun. You win either way.

## 9. REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS (Be Kind to Yourself)

**It's normal if:**
- Some guests are more into it than others
- Not everyone solves the mystery (that's why we have the cupcake reveal!)
- Timing runs a little long or short
- You forget to do something perfectly
- Someone asks "Wait, what am I supposed to do?" (just say "Chat and trade clues!")

**You're succeeding if:**
- ✅ People are talking and laughing
- ✅ Food is being eaten
- ✅ The vibe is relaxed and fun
- ✅ You're enjoying yourself too

**This is NOT a test.** It's a party with a fun activity. If people leave saying "That was fun!", you nailed it.
