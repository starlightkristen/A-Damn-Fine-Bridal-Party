# 🌲 Sharing the Planning Portal With Your Bridal Party

This guide provides ready-to-use message templates for inviting your bridal party members to the planning portal, complete with login instructions and troubleshooting tips.

---

## UPDATED RECOMMENDED MESSAGE (with login info)

```
Hey everyone! 🌲

I made a planning site for Marlena's shower so we can all collaborate:

🔗 https://starlightkristen.github.io/A-Damn-Fine-Bridal-Party/

TO LOG IN:
• Click the link → you'll see a login page
• Use: [EMAIL/PASSWORD - see options below]
• Then you can view everything and make edits!

It has the schedule, menu, mystery game, and all the details. Check it out when you can! ☕💛
```

---

## LOGIN OPTIONS TO INCLUDE

The message templates should explain one of these approaches (depending on how the site is configured):

### Option A: Shared Resident Login (Simple) - RECOMMENDED

This is the simplest approach for bridal party members. The site includes a "Resident Entrance" option that's specifically designed for guests.

```
TO LOG IN:
On the login page, scroll down to "Resident Entrance"
• Enter your name (e.g., Sarah Johnson)
• Enter your phone number (e.g., 555-0199)
• Click "Enter Village"

That's it - no password needed! You'll have view access and can add comments/suggestions.
```

**Behind the scenes:** This uses a shared account (`resident@damnfineparty.com` / `coffeeandpie2025`) but guests don't need to know this. Their name and phone are stored for tracking purposes.

### Option B: Shared Host Login (Simple)

If you want everyone to use the same credentials:

```
TO LOG IN:
Email: resident@damnfineparty.com
Password: coffeeandpie2025

(Everyone uses the same login - this is just for planning, not sensitive stuff!)
```

### Option C: Firebase Individual Accounts (if you created them)

If you created individual Firebase accounts for each person:

```
TO LOG IN:
I created an account for each of you:
• [Person 1]: email@example.com / password123
• [Person 2]: email2@example.com / password123

Check your name and use that login. You can change your password once logged in!
```

---

## NEW SECTION: "What They'll See After Login"

Add this to calm any anxiety:

```
ONCE YOU'RE LOGGED IN:

✅ See the full schedule and timeline
✅ Browse menu ideas and vote on favorites  
✅ Check out decor inspiration
✅ Read your mystery game character (if assigned)
✅ Add comments or suggestions

You don't HAVE to do anything - just exploring is totally fine! This is so we can all see the plan and make it work for everyone. 💛
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING SECTION

Add this section to help with common login issues:

```
## IF SOMEONE CAN'T LOG IN:

**"I don't see a login page"**
→ Make sure you're going to the full URL: https://starlightkristen.github.io/A-Damn-Fine-Bridal-Party/
→ The home page will redirect you to the login page automatically

**"Where do I enter my name and phone?"**
→ Scroll down on the login page past the email/password section
→ Look for "Resident Entrance" with a green button
→ That's where you enter your name and phone

**"It says invalid credentials"**
→ If using the email/password method, double-check you're using: resident@damnfineparty.com / coffeeandpie2025
→ Try copying and pasting the password (no extra spaces)

**"The Resident Entrance isn't working"**
→ Make sure you enter your full name (at least 2 characters)
→ Make sure your phone number is at least 7 digits
→ Try clicking "Enter Village" again

**"I'm logged in but can't edit anything"**
→ That's normal! The site shows you everything, and you can add comments/suggestions
→ For major changes, just text me and I'll update it

**"Do I need to create an account?"**
→ Nope! Just use the Resident Entrance with your name and phone
→ Or use the shared login credentials if I sent those

**STILL STUCK?**
→ Text me a screenshot and I'll help you out! 📱
```

## ADDITIONAL: In-Person Conversation Starter

```
## IF YOU'RE EXPLAINING IN PERSON:

"So I made us a planning website for the shower - don't worry, it's easy!

Just go to [show them the URL on your phone], and when you see the login page, scroll down to where it says 'Resident Entrance'. Put in your name and phone number, and you're in!

You can see everything we're planning - the schedule, food, the murder mystery game. It's all there.

You don't have to do anything with it, but I wanted everyone to be able to see what's happening and give feedback if you want to change stuff.

Want me to text you the link?"

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### 1. **Choose Your Login Method**

The site currently has **two login options**:

**Option A: Resident Entrance (RECOMMENDED for bridal party)**
- Simple: just name + phone number
- No password to remember
- Behind the scenes uses shared account
- Tracks who makes edits via session storage

**Option B: Host Login (for you)**
- Email/password authentication
- Full editing capabilities
- You can create additional Firebase accounts if needed

**Recommendation:** Use Resident Entrance for bridal party members. It's the easiest and they don't need to remember credentials.

### 2. **Test the Login Yourself First**

Before sharing with others:

1. Open the site in an **incognito/private browser window**
2. Go to: https://starlightkristen.github.io/A-Damn-Fine-Bridal-Party/
3. Try the Resident Entrance with a test name and phone
4. Verify you can see all the content
5. Try navigating to different pages (schedule, menu, etc.)
6. Make sure everything loads correctly

### 3. **Current Credentials Available**

Your site has these credentials configured:

**Resident Login (for bridal party):**
- Accessible via "Resident Entrance" form
- Behind the scenes: `resident@damnfineparty.com` / `coffeeandpie2025`
- Users just enter name + phone (they don't see the actual credentials)

**Host Login (for you):**
- Your Firebase account (email/password you set up)
- Full admin access

### 4. **Security Considerations**

- ✅ The resident login is perfect for planning (non-sensitive data)
- ✅ Credentials are simple but not obvious
- ✅ Name/phone tracking helps you know who's viewing
- ✅ You can always change Firebase passwords if needed
- ⚠️ Don't share your personal host login with others
- ⚠️ This is for event planning only - no sensitive data

### 5. **What Permissions Does Resident Login Have?**

With Resident Entrance login, users can:
- ✅ View all pages and content
- ✅ See the schedule, menu, decor, mystery details
- ✅ Make edits if the site allows (based on your configuration)
- ✅ Export data
- ⚠️ Changes are saved to browser storage unless Firebase sync is enabled

### 6. **Customizing Your Message**

When using the templates:

1. **Keep it SHORT** - Most people won't read long instructions
2. **Focus on the EASY path** - Resident Entrance is simplest
3. **Reassure them** - "You don't have to do anything, just explore!"
4. **Be available** - "Text me if you need help!"
5. **Test first** - Always verify the login works before sharing

### 7. **Alternative: Creating Individual Firebase Accounts**

If you want each person to have their own account:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
2. Create accounts with emails like: `sarah@damnfineparty.com`, `jen@damnfineparty.com`
3. Use simple passwords: `shower2025`
4. Send individual credentials to each person
5. Update your message template with the list

**Pros:** Individual tracking, personal accounts
**Cons:** More work to set up, people need to remember credentials
